Project description

The project will implement a car rental system for a car rental business.

This system will allow for three types of users: guests, members, and managers. Guests will be able to browse location, availability, price, and model. Members will have their personal information stored (i.e. name, address, and credit card information) and will have access to any specials. Finally, the administrator can change or update car models, prices, etc.

The system would be implemented using the Java programming language. We will utilize the java standard library and the interface would be constructed using the Java JFrame API.
